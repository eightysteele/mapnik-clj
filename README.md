# What is the mapnik-clj project? #

The mapnik-clj project is a [Clojure](https://github.com/clojure/clojure) wrapper for [Mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik), an API for building beautiful maps.

# Let's get started #

As a starting point we'll want to look at the [mapnik-jni](https://github.com/SpatialInteractive/mapnik-jni) project for Java bindings to Mapnik.
